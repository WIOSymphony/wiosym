  "description": "Using data provided by Be Geospatial AB, specific points within distinct coastal features associated with shrimp farming locations and offshore fish farming areas were manually selected. To extract Chl-a concentration values, which serve as an indicator for eutrophication, 10-km buffer zones were applied around the mariculture sites. These values were obtained from GCOM, and subsequently linearly normalized within a 1-100 scale, and mapped onto a reference grid. Known limitations: The chl-a index were mapped under curtain period of time using cut off threshold, this could underestimate or overestimated the actual eurotripication within the region",
