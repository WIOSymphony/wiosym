  "description": "Using seismic survey data from MapStand, seismic survey lines were converted to raster and given a linear weighting based on the frequency of the seismic survey. The output layer is scaled from 0-100. The dataset contains seismic surveys from the years 1969 to 2019. Thus, a value of 100 represents seismic surveys performed in 2019, a value of 50 represents seismic surveys performed in 1994, and a value of 1 represents seismic surveys performed in 1969. A value of zero indicates no record of seismic surveys occurring in that grid cell within the dataset. Known limitations: This layer assumes that the pressure of a a seismic survey correlates with its recency, although there may be other factors influencing the intensity of the pressures, such as depth or the shape of the seafloor.\n",
