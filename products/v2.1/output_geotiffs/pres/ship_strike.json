  "description": "Risk of ship strikes was estimated using global AIS data 2020-2022 provided by HUB Ocean. The data was divided into ship classes and summarized by ship time / year spent in each 1km gridcell. Ship time at anchor points was removed assuming vesselspeed at these locations were to low to risk collitions. Known limitations: Calculations are not taking ship speed into account.",
