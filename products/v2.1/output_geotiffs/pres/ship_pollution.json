  "description": "Ship pollution was estimated using global AIS data 2020-2022 provided by HUB Ocean. The data was divided into ship classes and summarized by ship time / year spent in each 1km gridcell. Known limitations: Calculations are not taking ship speed into account. The estimation of ship pollution based on vesseltypes and hours spent are uncertain as it does not have more detailed information of the cargo and environmental precautions of each ship.",
