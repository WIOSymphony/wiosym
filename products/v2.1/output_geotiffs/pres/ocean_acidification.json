  "description": "This ocean monitoring indicator (OMI) consists of annual mean rates of changes in surface ocean pH (yr-1) computed at 1°×1° resolution from 1985 until the last year. This indicator is derived from monthly pH time series distributed with the Copernicus Marine product MULTIOBS_GLO_BIO_CARBON_SURFACE_REP_015_008 (Chau et al., 2022a). Known limitations: Data are confident to the 90th percentile (data with uncertainty factors above 10% were excluded).",
