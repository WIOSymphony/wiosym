  "description": "A kernel density model of all hotels and lodges registered in Google Earth was used, applying a kernel density radius of 10 km. Known limitations: Hotels/accomodation may not necessarily perfectly represent pressures from marine tourism, as hotel density may be higher in certain areas for other reasons, such as terrestrial tourism.",
