  "name": "Piers and docks - Smaller harbors, docks, man-made piers - pressure layer from the WIO Symphony tool",
  "description": "This layer was produced by using manually collected data provided by Be Geospatial AB. The collected points were separated within different coastal features. 5-km buffer zones were used for masking around piers, docks and small port features to extract Total Suspended Matter (TSM) values derived from MODIS. Then the values were linearly nomalized within a 1-100 scale, and mapped onto the reference grid. Known limitations: The TSM index were mapped under curtain period of time using cut off threshold, this could underestimate or overestimated the actual turbidity within the region",
