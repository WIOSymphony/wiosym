  "description": "This layer was produced by using manually collected data provided by Be Geospatial AB. The collected points were separated within different coastal features. 5-km buffer zones were used for masking around land reclamation points, sea wall points and water movement change points, then rasterized into a raster and mapped onto the reference grid. Known limitations: The manually corrected data using the sattelite images within the curtain period of time, it could miss out some exist activities within this region and contain data gaps.\n",
