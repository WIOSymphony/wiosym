  "description": "Data on telecommunication submarine cables were used, from Greg's Cable Map (Greg Mahlknecht) and Telegeography, and merged together. Then, a focal statistics spatial analysis was performed using a wedge-shaped neighborhood by summation of 20 pixels cell radius within 0-360 degree looking angles. Finally, a linear normalization within a 0-100 scale was performed. Known limitations: The beffer zone can gives the bias to capture effect within this activity.\n",
