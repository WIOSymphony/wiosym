  "description": "The contamination data from The Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP) was used. The organic toxin data were extracted and combined with a hydrological flow accumulation to identify organic pollution areas within a reference grid. Known limitations: The collected data on this layers also missing the recorded on the chemical data on soem locations, the proxy hydrology model can cause the bias on identifying the actual pollution in some of the areas\n",
