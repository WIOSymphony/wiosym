  "description": "A weighted sum model was used for predicting nutrient pollutions, and the results were linearly normalized to a 1-100 scale. The predictors included in the model are surface current velocity, hydrological flow accumulation, run-off volume (curve number modelling on land covers), chlorophyll-a concentrations, and dissolved inorganic nutrients (phosphate and nitrate from the World Ocean Atlas 2018, and land-based nutrients on fertilizer use (N,P,K) in soils from iSDA). Known limitations: The chl-a index were mapped under curtain period of time using cut off threshold, this could underestimate or overestimated the actual eurotripication within the region",
