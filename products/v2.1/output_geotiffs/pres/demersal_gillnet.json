  "name": "Demersal gillnet - Commercial fishing using gillnets close to the bottom - pressure layer from the WIO Symphony tool",
  "description": "Mean yearly fishing hours in each grid cell were calculated from the years 2012-2020, based on Global Fishing Watch data, for vessels registered as using set gillnets. Kernel density modelling was then performed with a 50-km radius to remove noise. Known limitations: The Global Fishing Watch data is based on advanced algorithms to estimate fishing effort. However, there is a risk that vessels are incorrectly identified as fishing in the algorithm. Further, these data may not identify unregistered fishing boats.",
