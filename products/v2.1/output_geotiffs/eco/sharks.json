  "description": "Species distribution models (SDMs) were created for genera within four major shark orders: Carcharhiniformes (ground sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), Squaliformes (dogfish sharks) and Squatiniformes (angel sharks), using ensemble modelling with 25 predictor variables and observation records from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). Probability of occurrence maps produced in the SDM were then summed across all genera, to give an estimate that may serve as a proxy for species richness and/or biomass. Genera modelled: Lamniformes - Alopias (thresher sharks), Isurus (mako sharks), Carcharodon (great white shark); Carcharhiniformes - Galeocerdo (tiger shark), Sphyrna (hammerhead sharks), Carcharhinus (requiem/grey sharks); Squaliformes - Squalus (spurdogs), Etmopterus (lantern sharks); Squatiniformes â€“ Squatina (angelsharks). A specific shark SDM was created for the region from the southern border of Tanzania north to Mogadishu (Somalia) using data from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Institute. Known limitations: The species distribution models are based on available records, and therefore likely to contain observation bias. As such, the model is likely to overestimate occurrence in regions with many recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. South Africa) and underestimate occurrence in regions with few recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. Somalia).",
