  "description": "A hydrothermal vents dataset was used, as provided by The InterRidge Global Database of Active Submarine Hydrothermal Vent Fields, World data center PANGAEA. The database intends to provide a comprehensive list of active submarine hydrothermal vent fields, for use in academic research, education, and marine policy, and is primarily based on information from the open literature . The vector data defining the hydrothermal vent areas were cropped to the WIO Symphony area and then rasterized to the 1-km grid. Known limitations: Data on deep sea habitats is generally very limited. It is likely that many areas with hydrothermal vents are missing from this map.",
