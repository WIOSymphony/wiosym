  "description": "Global models, showing potential distribution of benthic and intertidal macroalgae (Rhodophyta and Phaeophyceae) inferred with mechanistic and correlative niche modelling by Duarte 2021, were used. The models were combined and resampled to the 1-km WIO Symphony grid followed by mapping as tropical / temperate macroalgae by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0). Known limitations: The model simulations capture areas with a high vs. low habitat suitability, but can not determine absolute grid-cell level probability of macroalgae, as  vital environmental data and sufficient observational data are missing. Also, this is a global model and the relevance to the WIO region local scales will vary greatly depending on underlying data availability and quality.",
