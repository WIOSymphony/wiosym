  "name": "Shallow hard - Rock, limestone (<40 m depth) - ecosystem component from the WIO Symphony tool",
  "description": "A seafloor substrate model, developed by C. Jenkins with regional support from S. Fennessy, was used, together with the dbSEABED database. Rock and gravel proportions were combined to create a hard bottom layer. The shallow zone was defined as 0-40 m using GEBCO 2022 data, and yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data was used to model the tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 23 °C (e.g. trop zone = 0) ending at 25.5 °C (e.g. trop zone =1). Known limitations: The underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO region.",
