  "description": "A geomorphic features dataset from Blue Habitats was used, which is mainly based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mapping (SRTM30_PLUS) 30-arc second database from 2009. The polygons of mid-ocean ridges were rasterized and cropped to the project area. Known limitations: The bathymetry that these data are based on is from 2009  and of varying quality.\n",
