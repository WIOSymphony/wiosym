  "description": "A seafloor substrate model, developed by C. Jenkins with regional support from S. Fennessy, was applied, together with the dbSEABED database. Rock and stone proportion were combined to create a hard bottom proportion. Then the hard bottoms were mapped within the continental slope zone (200-1000 m) using gebco 2022 data. Known limitations: The underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO. Direct measurements (e.g. seabed surveys) are required to increase the quality.",
