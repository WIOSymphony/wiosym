  "name": "Slope hard - Rock and stone along continental slope - ecosystem component from the WIO Symphony tool",
  "description": "This layer was produced by using a seafloor substrate model developed by C Jenkins with regional support from S Fennessy, using the dbSEABED database. Rock and stone proportion were combined to create a hard bottom proportion. Then the hard bottom were mapped within the continental slope zone 200-1000 meter using gebco 2022 data. Known limitations: Though this data represents best available data, the underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO. Direct measurements (e.g. seabed surveys) are required to increase the quality in detailed impact assessments",
