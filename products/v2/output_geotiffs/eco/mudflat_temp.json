  "description": "This layer was generated by extracting tidal areas from a 30m resolution global model (The global distribution and trajectory of tidal flats, 2019) based on Landsat data from 2002-2016. Presence of tidal flats were extracted into a 250m raster, then masked >20m depth using GEBCO depth data mapped to 250m grid on the African West coast (thus removing suspected artifacts in the remote sensing). The 250m raster were aggregated to 1km grid, generating a proportional value for each 1km pixel. Finally, it was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0) Known limitations: This layer represents tidal flats, rather then tidal mud flats, due to poor mud data at the resolution of tidal flats along the coast. Futher, the tidal flat model has been observed to falsy classify muddy waters/river plumes as tidal flats in some locations. Gebco depth model was used to mitigate this problem on the coast of west african, but in the WIO region the depth model was not enough quality along the coastlines, often claiming deeper depths then was observed in high resolution imagery.",
