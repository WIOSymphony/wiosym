  "description": "This layer is based on global models showing potential distribution of benthic and intertidal macroalgae (Rhodophyta and Phaeophyceae) inferred with mechanistic and correlative niche modelling by Duarte 2021. The models were combined and resampled to the 1km WIO Symphony grid followed by mapping as tropical / temperate macro algae by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0).\n Known limitations: This macro algae map is based on models and can't determine absolute grid cell level probability, as the models miss vital environmental data and sufficient observational data. Rather they capture areas with a high habitat suitability versus a low. This is a global model and the relevance to WIO region local scales will vary greatly depending on underlying data availability and quality",
