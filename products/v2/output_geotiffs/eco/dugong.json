  "description": "Species distribution models (SDMs) were created for the dugong (Dugong dugon). SDMs were created using ensemble modelling using 25 predictor variables (see code for details) and observation records from Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). The output layer was scaled to between 0 and 100, with 0 representing predicted absence, 1 representing the lowest predicted probability of presence, and 100 representing the highest predicted probability of presence. These probabilities may serve as a proxy for relative taxa abundance and/or biomass.",
