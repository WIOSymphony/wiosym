  "description": "This layer was produced by using a seafloor substrate model developed by C Jenkins with regional support from S Fennessy, using the dbSEABED database. Rock and gravel proportion were combined to create a hard bottom proportion. The continental shelf zone was defined by 40-200 meter using GEBCO 2022 data, and yearly average SBT (Sea Bottom Temperature) from Copernicus data was used to model the temperate zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 24 °C (e.g. temp zone = 0) ending at 21.5 °C (e.g. temp zone = 1) Known limitations: Though this data represent best available data, the underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO\n",
