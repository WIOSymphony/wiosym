  "name": "Abyss hard - Deep sea rock surfaces - ecosystem component from the WIO Symphony tool",
  "description": "This layer was produced by using a seafloor substrate model developed by C Jenkins with regional support from S Fennessy, using the dbSEABED database. Rock - gravel models were combined to create a hard bottom proportion. Then hard bottom were mapped within Abyssal plain depth zone (1000-7500 meter) using gebco 2022 data. Known limitations: Though this data represents best available data, the underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO. Direct measurements (e.g. seabed surveys) are required to increase the quality in detailed impact assessments",
