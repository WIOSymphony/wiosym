  "description": "A seafloor substrate model, developed by C. Jenkins with regional support from S. Fennessy, was applied, together with the dbSEABED database. Sand-mud proportions were combined to create a soft bottom layer. The shallow zone was defined as 0-40 m using GEBCO 2022 data, and yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data was used to model the temperate zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp zone = 0) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp zone = 1). Known limitations: The underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO region.",
