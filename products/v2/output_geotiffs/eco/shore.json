  "description": "This layer was produced using shoreline derived from 30m resolution SRTM data from which presence of shoreline were registered at 50m resolution. The proportion of 50m shoreline pixels within each 1km cell were calculated and mapped into the reference grid. Finally, the layer was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0) Known limitations: The map of shoreline habitats are quite accurate (based on detailed shoreline from remote sensing), but is limited by the very simplistic way to define shorline habitats e.g. by the total length of the shoreline in every gridcell. Future studies might want to add information of the type of shoreline.\n",
