  "description": "This layer was produced by using a seafloor substrate model developed by C Jenkins with regional support from S Fennessy, using the dbSEABED database. Rock and gravel proportion were combined to create a hard bottom layer. Shallow zone was defined as 0-40meter using GEBCO 2022 data, and yearly average SST from Copernicus data was used to model the tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 23 °C (e.g. trop zone = 0) ending at 25.5 °C (e.g. trop zone =1) Known limitations: Though this data represent best available data, the underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO\n",
