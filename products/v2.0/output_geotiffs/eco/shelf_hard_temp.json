  "description": "A seafloor substrate model, developed by C. Jenkins with regional support from S. Fennessy, together with the dbSEABED database. Rock and gravel proportion were combined to create a hard bottom proportion. The continental shelf zone was defined as 40-200 m using GEBCO 2022 data, and yearly average SBT (Sea Bottom Temperature) from Copernicus data was used to model the temperate zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 24 °C (e.g. temp zone = 0) ending at 21.5 °C (e.g. temp zone = 1). Known limitations: The underlying substrate and bathymetry models are uncertain in most areas of the WIO region.",
