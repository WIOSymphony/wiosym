  "description": "Proportion of mesopelagic waters (photic zone to seafloor <1000m depth) in relation to full ocean depth (6000 m) based on GEBCO 2022 bathymetry grid and photic depth from Copernicus. Known limitations: Depth data is uncertain in most areas, which can have some effects on this layer. Another limitation is that the current midwater pelagic habitat layer is only based on volume of available ocean space, not considering productivity or biodiversity.",
