A protocol was established for identifying artisinal fishing boats. However, there is a risk that boats were incorrectly identified as artisinal fishing boats, or were missed.;A model that calculates the least cost paths from boat locations to all other ocean pixels was used. The model estimates artisanal fishing pressure based on a kernel density model, which assumes that the probability of a moored boat fishing at a given location declines with distance from the moored boat.

22;Pressure;Fishing;Other fishing;The relationship between boat detections from night lights and fishing activity has been shown in numerous publications, still the link between the fishing pressure and the lights is uncertain. Some boat detections from other activities such as around ports and boat activities around oil platforms are still in the data, but spatial patterns of obvious unreported fishing activities can also be seen.;The other fishing layer is based on vessel detections 2017-2020 by Elvidge C et al using NASA VIIRS nightlight data which was then interpolated using focal statistics to provide intensity of vessels observed in each area. The intensity layer was normalised 0-100 and adjusted to normalised data from all known fishing activities, as well as port and fixed lights from oil platforms. The residual which were only captured by the night light vessel detection is what makes up the “Other fishing” layer, assuming it is mainly unreported fishing which is the light emitting night activity taking place there.

28;Pressure;Litter;Ghost fishing;This layer is based on proximity to fishing activites and does not take into account ocean currents, which are likely to play a role in the distribution of ghost fishing gear.;Gear loss risks were simulated by multiplying the fishing efforts per gear type with published gear loss factors, with subsequent distribution in space using a kernels function. The fishing gear loss factors are based on “proportion of gear lost” from Tables 1 to 3 in Richardson et al. 2019 (“Estimates of fishing gear loss rates at a global scale: A literature review and meta‐analysis”, Fish and Fisheries 20, 1218-1231). For pole and lines, the Richardson et al. 2019 estimate of 0.65 was stated to be an overestimate (Pham et al., 2021, “Abandoned, Lost or Otherwise Discarded Fishing Gear (ALDFG) in Tuna Pole-and-Line Fisheries”). We therefore decided to instead use the longline loss factor also for poles and lines. For dredging, we applied the loss factors of bottom trawling. For nets and lines, we assumed drifting distances of up to 1000 km, see Stelfox et al. 2020 for trajectory simulations (“Minimum drift times infer trajectories of ghost nets found in the Maldives”, Marine Pollution Bulletin 154, 111037). For pots and traps, we assumed that they sink faster than nets and lines, and set drifting distances of up to 300 km (no reference). Maximum value representation: 15% gear loss rate.

29;Pressure;Litter;Plastic litter;The plastic layer is limited by the resolution and accuracy of a global model. To better represent the coastal area and trace the local sources of plastic pollution, additional data such as high resolution, satellite imagery, land-cover data, census data, and other relevant data sources would be needed.;A new global model of plastic pollution in the oceans and coastline, available as 60-km hexagon grids, was adjusted to the WIO Symphony 1-km grid. Data was available for a range of particle sizes, as particle mass or concentration and with predictions from years 2015, 2020 and 2025. For the WIO Symphony model, total concentration of particles larger than 5 mm from the 2020 prediction was used. The data was split up in two ways, the shore prediction, and the pelagic data (divided into 0-5 m (surface), 5-50 m, 50-500 m and 500 m-inf depth layers). The interpolation for each individual layer was made using the centre points of the hexagon grids, applying Inverse Distance Weighting at 10-km spacing, then converting to a 1-km grid using bilinear interpolation. Shoreline plastic: The interpolated plastic shore data model was multiplied with the WIO Symphony shore layer which contains the proportion of shoreline within each pixel, hence assuming more complex shorelines result in a higher pressure from plastic pollution within a 1-km pixel. In addition, a 2-km Gaussian filter was run and combined with this data, assuming plastic has a local spread into the nearby environment. Finally, the data was normalized to 0-100 using the maximum value in the WIO region (99% quantile to exclude outliers). Pelagic plastic: The interpolated concentrations of plastic particles for each depth layer where combined using the maximum value in each 1-km grid cell. The data were then normalized to 0-100 using the global maximum value (99% quantile to exclude outliers). Combined product: The two normalized layers were combined into one using the maximum value in each cell. As a nod to the theory behind the layer created for v01 of WIO Symphony (using extrapolation from the main river sources), areas highlighted as polluted in v01 were included if 10% of the max value was greater than v02 (e.g., max(plastic_v01 * 0.1, plastic v02)). This step mainly added plastic pollution in areas close to large rivers with high plastic concentrations, not always captured in the coarser global 60-km hexagon models. Maximum value representation: High plastic concentrations relative to global data - grams/m3 in the ocean, grams/m on beaches.

33;Pressure;Offshore development;Oil gas industry;This model does not take into account ocean currents that would likely have a large influence on the dispersal of hydrocarbons.;A kernel density model of oil and gas platforms and pipelines was used, based on data from MapStand. Platforms were assumed to discharge 45 kgs of hydrocarbons per year in their immediate proximity, based on estimates by the National Research Council (US) Committee on Oil in the Sea (2003, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25057607/). Pipelines were assumed to discharge 46 kgs of hydrocarbons per year in their immediate proximity, based on the same source. Thus, the output layer is scaled from 0-100, with 100 representing 91 kg of hydrocarbon discharge per year, and a value of 1 representing 0.91 kg of discharge per year, scaling linearly.

46;Pressure;Shipping;Underwater noise;The spreading of sound in the ocean and the interaction with marine life is very complex and a more detailed map would need a detailed oceanographic model to go along with it, as well as sound data for every vessel, and more. The model makes some simple assumptions to get the spreading of sound and the intensity of its occurrence on the map for planners to see where risk of impact is higher or lower. More detailed studies are needed to understand its impact on marine life.;Ship noise and exposure time were estimated from global AIS data 2020-2022 provided by HUB Ocean.

48;Pressure;Survey;Seismic surveys;This layer assumes that the pressure of a a seismic survey correlates with its recency, although there may be other factors influencing the intensity of the pressures, such as depth or the shape of the seafloor.
;Using seismic survey data from MapStand, seismic survey lines were converted to raster and given a linear weighting based on the frequency of the seismic survey. The output layer is scaled from 0-100. The dataset contains seismic surveys from the years 1969 to 2019. Thus, a value of 100 represents seismic surveys performed in 2019, a value of 50 represents seismic surveys performed in 1994, and a value of 1 represents seismic surveys performed in 1969. A value of zero indicates no record of seismic surveys occurring in that grid cell within the dataset. Maximum value representation: Close proximity (less than 1 km) from underwater seismic surveys performed in the last 5 years.
