7;Ecosystem;Habitat Oceanic seafloor;Cold coral reef;The model simulations can not determine absolute grid- cell level probability of cold-water coral habitats, as vital data on substrate type and biological interactions are missing. Low and variable resolution of bathymetry data is also a major known limitation.;Ten global models (in press 2023) of different cold-water coral species were combined (Desmophyllum pertusum, Enallopsammia rostrata, Goniocorella dumosa, Oculina varicosa, Solenosmilia variabilis, Paragorgia arborea, Primnoa resedaeformis, Madrepora oculata, Acanella arbuscula, Paramuricea placomus), as provided by Dr. Tong R. and Dr. Davies to the WIO Symphony grid, then removing shallow water (<40 m) predictions in tropical regions using gebco 2022 data. The models depict areas with low vs. high habitat suitability, i.e. the likelihood of finding suitable cold-water coral habitats. Values below the background level (50% quantile value) were set to 0 in the normalisation process. Maximum value representation: High habitat suitability.

9;Ecosystem;Habitat Oceanic seafloor;Seamounts;The data on seamounts are limited by the resolution and accuracy of global bathymetry. Many smaller seamounts are likely missing in the data. The higher weighting of shallow seamounts is also uncertain, especially for activities that have direct seafloor impact such as deep-sea mining and bottom trawling. The knowledge of the life and sensitivity of these deep sea habitats is very limited.;Two global seamount datasets were combined, i.e. Yesson et al. 2019 (based on the global bathymetry SRTM v.11) and Gevorgian et al. 2023 (based on the latest vertical gravity gradient derived from satellite altimeter measurements), which both infer seamount presence by using a series of algorithms to look for conical features on the seabed. Yesson et al. 2019 outlines the seamount bases, while Gevorgian et al. 2023 specifies the seamount centre and the radius of the bases. Though plenty of overlap existed, the two datasets had slightly different coverage and strengths and were combined to a maximum seamount extent presence at 250-m grid resolution, then aggregated to seamount presence proportion at 1-km resolution. Subsequently, the latest bathymetry model from Gebco (2023) was used to give relatively shallow seamount areas (< 1000m depth) higher weight in WIO Symphony sensitivity (i.e., maximum value 100), with a linear gradient down to 5000 m (value 25).  The resampled bathymetry at 250 m was aggregated to provide a weighting value at the 1-km scale, and then multiplied with the proportional presence of seamounts raster. Maximum value representation: 100% cover of shallow seamounts (<1000m). GeoTIFF download: https://github.com/WIOSymphony/wiosym/raw/main/products/v2.1/output_geotiffs/eco/seamounts.tif.

The models were combined and resampled to the 1-km WIO Symphony grid followed by mapping as tropical / temperate macroalgae by using the yearly average SST (sea surface temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate / tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5°C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1), ending at 23°C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0).

15;Ecosystem;Habitat Temperate;Mudflat (temp);This layer represents tidal flats, rather than tidal mud flats, due to poor mud data at the resolution of tidal flats along the coast. Further, it is known that the tidal flat model has erroneously classifiedmuddy waters/river plumes as tidal flats in some locations. The Gebco depth model was used to mitigate this problem on the West African coast, but in the WIO region the depth model was not of high enough quality along the coastlines, often claiming deeper depths than observed in high resolution imagery.;Tidal areas were extracted from a 30-m resolution global model (“The global distribution and trajectory of tidal flats”, 2019) based on Landsat data from 2002-2016. Presence of tidal flats were extracted into a 250-m raster, then masked >20 m depth using GEBCO depth data mapped to a 250-m grid on the African West coast (thus removing suspected artefacts in the remote sensing). The 250-m raster data was aggregated to a 1-km grid, generating a proportional value for each 1-km pixel. Finally, it was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0) Maximum value representation: 100% cover.

16;Ecosystem;Habitat Temperate;Penguin feedground;The species distribution models are based on available records, and therefore likely to contain observation bias. As such, the model is likely to overestimate occurrence in regions with many recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. South Africa), and underestimate occurrence in regions with few recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. Somalia).;Species distribution models (SDMs) were created for the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus; the only penguin species occurring in the WIO region), using ensemble modelling with 25 predictor variables (see code for details ) and observation records from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). The output layer was scaled to between 0 and 100, with 0 representing predicted absence, 1 representing the lowest predicted probability of presence, and 100 representing the highest predicted probability of presence. These probabilities may serve as a proxy for relative taxa abundance and/or biomass. Maximum value representation: High probability of occurrence.

17;Ecosystem;Habitat Temperate;Salt marsh (temp);The salt marsh pixel wered assumes using NDVI values and  were removed out mangroves pixels and masked out within tidal flat areas, however it may contain other vegetations within this layer;The salt marsh were created from tidal areas were extracted from a 30-m resolution global model (“The global distribution and trajectory of tidal flats”, 2019) based on Landsat data from 2002-2016. Presence of tidal flats were extracted into a 250-m raster, then masked >20 m depth using GEBCO depth data mapped to a 250-m grid on the African West coast (thus removing suspected artefacts in the remote sensing). The 250-m raster data was aggregated to a 1-km grid, generating a proportional value for each 1-km pixel. Finally, it was divided into temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0), then extracted the proxy using vegetation pixels from NDVI values and removed out mangrove  pixels.

18;Ecosystem;Habitat Temperate;Seagrass bed (temp);The combination of the many maps represents an effort to put the best available information together, still the maps are likely to over- or underpredict seagrasses in most areas. Especially the deeper seagrasses, and seagrasses in more turbid waters, are very poorly mapped. Very few detailed maps exist for the temperate region, most data are from the global predictive model. In all, the full extent of the seagrass ecosystems remains unknown, and planners should note that large important seagrass areas may not yet be in the map.;A number of seagrass data sources in the WIO region and globally were combined, including WCMC, Allen Coral Atlas and Living Ocean Foundation maps, and a new predictive model was constructed for the Saya del Mahla banks where sparse observations but no map existed. The maps were ranked by quality, and adjusted and combined based on ranking, information from overlapping higher resolution maps, and in some instances the Gebco depth model to remove unlikely locations. The combined 1-km resolution seagrass map was divided into tropical and temperate maps using a Sea Surface Temperature Copernicus data composite with a continuous gradient between 23-25.5 degC. 
The major steps included:
(1) Mapping the Allen Coral Atlas seagrass polygons presence to a 250-m grid, then calculating proportion of 250-m presence pixels within each 1-km pixel. In addition, total map footprint proportion were mapped to 1-km pixels. 
(2) Same process as (1) for three additional high-resolution maps (Seagrasses in estuaries in ZAF from Nelson Mandela University, Seagrasses in Chagos and Seychelles from Khaled bin Sultan Living Ocean Foundation)
(3) Global Seagrass map from the WCMC portal was mapped same as (1), but due to variable spatial resolution and accuracy it was adjusted with a coefficient calculated by comparing the mean cover in the Allen Atlas 1-km map with the WCMC 1-km map. Further, unlikely/deep areas were masked using Gebco bathymetry.
(4) Seagrass observations (points) from the WCMC portal were buffered with 750-m radius and mapped as presence in 250-m pixels -> proportion of 1-km pixels
(5) A BRT machine learning model was developed for Saya Del Mahla Bank, modelling seagrass coverage based on % cover data published by Ramah S. et al. The model uncertainty is high, but predicts seagrasses in regions of the banks known to have seagrass (personal conversation Dr. Rawat and others) which are currently not available in any open maps. 
(6) A Global Maxent model from the WCMC portal was mapped same as (1), then adjusted to the Allen data and bathymetry (same as 3).
(7) All maps were mosaiced together in order of their ranking, using map footprint to mask out lower ranked maps, then choosing the max value in the remaining overlap. The mean value was used for the overlapping area in Saya del Mahla between the WCMC polygon and modelled map.

23;Ecosystem;Habitat Temperate env;Shore (temp);The maps of shoreline habitats are quite accurate (based on validation with detailed shoreline from remote sensing), but are limited by the simplistic way to define shoreline habitats, e.g. by the total length of the shoreline in every gridcell. Future studies might want to add information of the type of shoreline.;Presence of shoreline was derived at 50-m resolution from the 30-m resolution SRTM  data. The proportion of 50-m shoreline pixels within each 1-km cell were calculated and mapped into the reference grid. Finally, the layer was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0). Maximum value representation: High proportion - measured as proportion of shoreline presence in each 50 m area within the 1-km pixel.

24;Ecosystem;Habitat Tropical;Algae bed;The model simulations capture areas with a high vs. low habitat suitability, but can not determine absolute grid-cell level probability of macroalgae, as  vital environmental data and sufficient observational data are missing. Also, this is a global model and the relevance to the WIO region local scales will vary greatly depending on underlying data availability and quality.;Global models, showing potential distribution of benthic and intertidal macroalgae (Rhodophyta and Phaeophyceae) inferred with mechanistic and correlative niche modelling by Duarte 2021, were used. The models were combined and resampled to the 1-km WIO Symphony grid followed by mapping as tropical / temperate macroalgae by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0).

25;Ecosystem;Habitat Tropical;Coral reef;The coral reef map combines all open sources of coral reef data, and also uses some creative solutions to put coral reef on the map where data was missing (low confidence modelling of Saya del Mahla banks) to put known but unmapped reef areas in the tool. The quality of these maps varies greatly across the region and also it is likely that many reefs are missing in the deeper areas 20-40m since the most comprehensive data set (ACA) has a depth limit of 15-20 meter. Though this map represents the best-known information of coral reef it needs to be used with care, especially when activities that can harm coral reefs are planned. Further studies and mapping efforts are needed.;A number of coral data sources in the WIO region and globally were combined, and a new predictive model was constructed for the Saya de Malha Banks where sparse observations but no map excisted. The maps were ranked by quality and adjusted and combined based on ranking, and information from overlapping higher resolution maps. 
The major steps included:
(1) Mapping the Allen Coral Atlas coral polygons presence to a 250-m grid, then calculating the proportion of 250-m presence pixels within each 1-km pixel. Further, total map footprint proportions were mapped to 1-km pixels 
(2) Same process as (1) for two additional high-resolution maps: Corals in Chagos and Seychelles from the Khaled bin Sultan Living Ocean Foundation
(3) The Global Coral map from the WCMC portal was mapped same as (1), but due to variable spatial resolution and accuracy it was adjusted with a coefficient calculated by comparing the mean cover in the Allen Atlas 1-km map with the WCMC 1-km map. 
(4) A 2008 coral map for Madagascar was retrieved from the African Marine Atlas through the Ocean Info HUB project. It was mapped similar to (3), by adjusting coverage to a coefficient by comparing with the higher resolution Allen Coral reef map. 
(5) A BRT machine learning model was developed for the Saya Del Mahla Bank, modelling coral coverage based on % cover data published by Ramah S. et al. The model uncertainty is high, but predicts coral in regions of the banks known to have coral (personal conversation Dr. Rawat and others) which are currently not available in any open maps. 
(6) All maps were mosaiced  together in order of their ranking, using map footprint to mask out lower ranked maps, then choosing the max value in the remaining overlap.

The Gebco depth model was used to mitigate this problem on the West African coast, but in the WIO region the depth model was not of high enough quality along the coastlines, often claiming deeper depths than observed in high resolution imagery.;Presence of tidal areas was extracted into a 250-m raster from a 30-m resolution global model (“The global distribution and trajectory of tidal flats”, 2019) based on Landsat data from 2002-2016, then masked >20 m depth using GEBCO depth data mapped to a 250-m grid on the African West coast (thus removing suspected artefacts in the remote sensing). The 250-m rasters were aggregated to a 1-km grid, generating a proportional value for each 1-km pixel. Finally, it was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0).

30;Ecosystem;Habitat Tropical;Seagrass bed;The combination of the many maps represents an effort to put the best available information together, still the maps are likely to over- or underpredict seagrasses in most areas. Especially the seagrasses in deeper and in more turbid waters are poorly mapped. In Chagos, seagrasses have been reported to 70 m depth but only the shallow ones are represented in the map. The Saya Del Mahla banks have notations to be the largest seagrass beds on the planet but with the poor data available we do not know. The model in the WIO Symphony seagrass map needs much more observational data to be reliable. In all, the full extent of the seagrass ecosystems remains unknown, and planners should note that large important seagrass areas may not yet be in the map.;A number of seagrass data sources in the WIO region and globally were combined, including WCMC, Allen Coral Atlas and Living Ocean Foundation maps, and a new predictive model was constructed for the Saya del Mahla banks where sparse observations but no map existed. The maps were ranked by quality, and adjusted and combined based on ranking, information from overlapping higher resolution maps, and in some instances the Gebco depth model to remove unlikely locations. The combined 1-km resolution seagrass map was divided into tropical and temperate maps using a Sea Surface Temperature Copernicus data composite with a continuous gradient between 23-25.5 degC. 
The major steps included:
(1) Mapping the Allen Coral Atlas seagrass polygons presence to a 250-m grid, then calculating proportion of 250-m presence pixels within each 1-km pixel. In addition, total map footprint proportion were mapped to 1-km pixels. 
(2) Same process as (1) for three additional high-resolution maps (Seagrasses in estuaries in ZAF from Nelson Mandela University, Seagrasses in Chagos and Seychelles from Khaled bin Sultan Living Ocean Foundation)
(3) Global Seagrass map from the WCMC portal was mapped same as (1), but due to variable spatial resolution and accuracy it was adjusted with a coefficient calculated by comparing the mean cover in the Allen Atlas 1-km map with the WCMC 1-km map. Further, unlikely/deep areas were masked using Gebco bathymetry.
(4) Seagrass observations (points) from the WCMC portal were buffered with 750-m radius and mapped as presence in 250-m pixels -> proportion of 1-km pixels
(5) A BRT machine learning model was developed for Saya Del Mahla Bank, modelling seagrass coverage based on % cover data published by Ramah S. et al. The model uncertainty is high, but predicts seagrasses in regions of the banks known to have seagrass (personal conversation Dr. Rawat and others) which are currently not available in any open maps. 
(6) A Global Maxent model from the WCMC portal was mapped same as (1), then adjusted to the Allen data and bathymetry (same as 3).
(7) All maps were mosaiced together in order of their ranking, using map footprint to mask out lower ranked maps, then choosing the max value in the remaining overlap. The mean value was used for the overlapping area in Saya del Mahla between the WCMC polygon and modelled map.

35;Ecosystem;Habitat Tropical env;Shore;The maps of shoreline habitats are quite accurate (based on validation with detailed shoreline from remote sensing), but are limited by the simplistic way to define shoreline habitats, e.g. by the total length of the shoreline in every gridcell. Future studies might want to add information of the type of shoreline.;Presence of shoreline was derived at 50-m resolution from the 30-m resolution SRTM data. The proportion of 50-m shoreline pixels within each 1-km cell were calculated and mapped into the reference grid. Finally, the layer was divided into tropical and temperate areas by using the yearly average SST (Sea Surface Temperature) from Copernicus data to model the temperate/tropical zone with a linear ramp-up starting at 25.5 °C (e.g. temp = 0, trop = 1) ending at 23 °C (e.g. temp =1, trop = 0).

As such, the model is likely to overestimate occurrence in regions with many recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. South Africa) and underestimate occurrence in regions with few recorded observations of marine wildlife (e.g. Somalia).;Species distribution models (SDMs) were created for genera within the taxonomic groups Clupeidae (herrings, shads, sardines, hilsa, and menhadens) and Engraulidae (anchovies), using ensemble modelling with 25 predictor variables and observation records from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS).
