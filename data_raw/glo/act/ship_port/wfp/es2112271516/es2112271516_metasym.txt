"comments"	"This layer contains ports locations. This dataset brings together various public sources with WFP logistics information. It is updated regularly with inputs from WFP logistics but also from many partners through the Logistics Cluster and the Logistics Capacity Assessment (LCA: dlca.logcluster.org). The information is compiled at a global level by the Emergency and Preparedness Geospatial Information Unit at the World Food Programme (WFP) Headquarters in Rome, Italy.

This dataset is at a global scale and is updated country by country. The last update date can be retrieved from the data of the country of interest.

Feel free to contribute to this dataset by contacting hq.gis@wfp.org."
