"comments"	"The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare, and draw insights for one’s own analysis. The database covers approximately 30,000 power plants from 164 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g., coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g., hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated, and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. The database will be continuously updated as data becomes available."
