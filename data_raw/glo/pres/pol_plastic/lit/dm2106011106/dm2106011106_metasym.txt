Here we provide the outputs from the model presented in Meijer et al. 2021 for the mid-point scenario of mismanaged plastic waste generation. The dataset distributed as GIS shapefile, represents 31,819 river outfalls emitting floating macro-plastic pollution globally. The emissions are expressed in metric tons per year.
