"comments"	"This is a MaxEnt model map of the global distribution of the Laminarian kelp biome. This was modelled using 44,265 cleaned primary occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and 13 environmental variables from the Global Marine Environment Datasets (GMED). Those variables included depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate concentration, average and maximum sea surface temperature, salinity, and others."
