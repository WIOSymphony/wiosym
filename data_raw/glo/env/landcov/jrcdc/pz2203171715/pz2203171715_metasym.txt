"comments"	"Title: Rainfall Erosivity in the World
Description: This map provides a complete rainfall erosivity dataset for the whole World based on 3625 precipitation stations and around 60,000 years of rainfall records at high temporal resolution (1 to 60 minutes). Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) model was used to interpolate the rainfall erosivity values of single stations and to generate the R-factor map.
Spatial coverage: World
Pixel size: 30 arc-seconds (~1 km at the Equator).
Measurement Unit: MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1
Projection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area
Temporal coverage: 30-40 years - Predominant in the last decade: 2000 - 2010
