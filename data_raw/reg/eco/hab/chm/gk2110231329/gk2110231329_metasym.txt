"comments"	"Citation of selection of text: Current knowledge holds that the bank supports the largest contiguous seagrass beds in the world, with 80 to 90% of shallow surfaces being covered by seagrasses dominated almost exclusively by Thalassondendron ciliatum, from depths up to 30-40 m, with additional records of Halophila decipiens and Enhalus acoroides. Coral reefs appear limited to rocky patches and outcrops, and likely to the edges of the bank. A partial survey conducted in 2002 documented that seagrass covers roughly 80 to 90% of the bottom, with corals covering between 10 and 20%, and sandy areas covering the remaining 5% (Hilbertz et al 2002)."
